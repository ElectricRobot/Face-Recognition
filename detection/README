DETECTION MODULE 
Author: Elena Holobiuc

Detection module - it can be used to detect one or more faces from an input image.
The detection parameters can be viewed in the Detection.h file.

The parameters are set with the initialize method in a vector of char*. If you want to use the default parameters, do not
call the initialize method.

To test the detection module perform the following commands:

make 
./detection fileName

The fileName parameter is a file in which you can list the images you want to recognize people from ( for example faces.in).
The results will be located in the result folder ( if it does not exist, it will be created automatically).

You can find test images in database1, database2 and database3.
