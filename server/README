SERVER MODULE 
Author: Octavian Sima 

This module is used for the face recognition mobile phone application,
but it can be easilly adapted for other applications.
The server can be run on different platforms setting the "reverseOrder" field 
for BigEndian or LittleEndian byte orders.
It is able to handle multiple clients starting a new thread when a client
connects. The thread deals with image file transfer and detection recognition stuff.

HOWTO RUN:
	1.   make
	2.   ./run_server listenPort

If you want to change byte order, modify reverseBytes to true/false in Run_Server.cpp.
To deactivate ACK after each message, modify USE_ACK constant value in Server.h.
To hide debug messages, modify DEBUG_ON constant value in Server.h.

Other options are available in Server.h.
